# collatz-conjecture-cpp
A very basic calculator to see if a positive integer holds to the Collatz conjecture. Well, we know numbers up to 2^68 hold to the conjecture because mathematicians brute-force calculated up to that point, this is just a fun little thing for you to see exactly how the numbers cycle through the hailstone numbers which arise from the algorithm which the conjecture follows. 

As of now, this program also gives you the number of times each digit from 1-9 appears as a leading digit in the hailstone numbers.
